# 2D Survival Game

A simple 2D survival game where you need to collect resources and avoid enemies to survive as long as possible.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the WASD keys to move your character:
   - W: Move up
   - A: Move left
   - S: Move down
   - D: Move right
3. Use the mouse to aim and click to shoot arrows at enemies.

## Game Elements

- **Player (White Square)**: Your character that you control.
- **Resources**:
  - Green: Food (increases food stat)
  - Blue: Water (increases water stat)
  - Red: Medicine (increases health)
  - Yellow: Arrows (increases arrow count)
- **Enemies**:
  - Gray: Wolves (faster, less damage, less health)
  - Brown: Bears (slower, more damage, more health)
  - Mini Golem: Small and agile, deals moderate damage
  - Shield Golem: Large and heavily armored, absorbs a lot of damage before being defeated
  - Golem Titan: The largest and most powerful enemy, requires precise aiming to defeat
- **Arrows**: White projectiles that can damage enemies

## Game Mechanics

- Your health, food, and water decrease over time.
- If your food or water reaches zero, your health will start decreasing.
- If your health reaches zero, the game is over.
- Each day lasts 60 seconds.
- New resources and enemies spawn at the beginning of each day.
- Resources and enemies also spawn randomly throughout the game.
- You can shoot arrows at enemies to damage them.
- Each arrow deals 20 damage to enemies.
- The goal is to survive as many days as possible.

## Tips

- Prioritize collecting food and water to maintain your stats.
- Collect yellow arrow packs to replenish your arrow supply.
- Use arrows to take down enemies from a safe distance.
- Avoid enemies when possible, as they can quickly reduce your health.
- Use medicine to recover health when needed.
- Plan your movements carefully to maximize resource collection while avoiding enemies.

Enjoy the game!
